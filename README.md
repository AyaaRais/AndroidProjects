/*Project setup*/
How do I get started with the project? Which steps are needed to build and run it from a cold start?

Ideally, this section simply states something like this:

Clone the repo, open the project in Android Studio, hit "Run". Done!

If setup is more complicated, you should state exactly which steps are necessary to get started. What software do I need to install? Which specific bash commands do I need to run? Be specific.
